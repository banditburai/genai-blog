#### 🎨 **What's the Style Tuner?**

Use the Style Tuner to visually craft a unique `--style` for your prompts.

---

#### 🛠 **Making Your Style**

1. **Start**: Type `/tune` followed by your prompt. Like: `/tune sunset over the mountains`.
2. **Configuration**: Choose from 16, 32, 64, or 128 pairs of images. More images = more GPU time.
3. **Wait**: After you see and accept the GPU cost, give it a moment to prepare your images.
4. **Open Link**: You'll get a URL via Direct Message. Open it in a web browser to see and pick styles.
5. **Choose View**: "Two at a time" (Pair mode) or "All together" (Grid mode).
6. **Making Selections**: Remember, the more choices you make, the less distinct each one will feel. It's okay to skip rows! Picking just a few images can give you a clearer style result.
7. **Get Your Code**: Your picks define a `--style` code. Play around! Every new pick generates a new code. 
8. **Use the Code**: In Discord, add `--style <code>` to your prompts to use your custom style!

#### 🎓 **More on `--style` Codes**

- Your custom `--style` nudges the system's biases on things like composition, coherency, medium, mood, and subject.
- `--style` mixes with your prompts. Different prompts can give different results.
- Tweak how strong a style is with `--s` values. (From `20-1000`)
- To view the style tuner page for any style code, simply add the code to the end of this URL: 🔗 `https://tuner.midjourney.com/code/{StyleCode}`

---

#### 🌟 **Helpful Hints**

- Unsure of the look? Try changing the `--s` value. (The default is `--s 100`)
- On a phone? Use your phone's browser for a better experience.

#### 🚀 **Mastering Advanced Tricks**

1. **Style Blending**:
    - Combine different styles by separating the codes with a dash: `--style codeA-codeB-codeC`.
    - Influence style weight by repeating codes: `codeA-codeA-codeB`.
2. **Surprise Me!**: "`--style random`" generates a random style. You can pick how varied it is!
		- Control variety: e.g., `random-{length of tuner}-{percentage}`
	    - Ex. `random-128-100` (128 tuner rows, skipping none or 100% active selections)
	    - Or `random-16-25` will be a random style tuner of 16 image pairs where 25% of the pairs are selected, and 75% skipped. The higher the percentage, the more muddled the stylistic result.

#### 🎁 **Bonus Tips**

- Pin your last used style in your `/settings` with `📌 Sticky Style`.
- Making a Style Tuner costs, but sharing the link is free.
- Pass your style codes or Tuner links to buddies!
- You don't pay again for using old tuner URLs. Share, experiment and explore!
